# EEG_Attention

## project in dev branch

EEG_Energy.py is the Fourier Transform and energy acquirer

Exports energy of electrodes to csv -> frequency_parameters.csv

Manually added parameters labels in frequency_parameters.csv

After that two classifiers are applied using those parameters: Support Vector Machine and Random Forest

Attention identification with Machine Learning algorithms in Attention_ML_Model_20_electrodes.ipynb
