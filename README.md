# EEG_Attention

#### This project goal is to make a attention identification using EEG signals during arithmetic tasks vs rest situation
#### Energy of Fourier Transform of each electrode was acquired and splited in 5 frequency bands
#### After that Machine Learning techniques were used to make the attention identification
#### 94% of accuracy was achived
#### project in dev branch
